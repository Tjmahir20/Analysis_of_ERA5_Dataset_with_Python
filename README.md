# Analysis_of_ERA5_Dataset_with_Python
In this group assignment, we worked on ERA5_2mTemp_19900101-19900531_00h.nc, temperature data from January to May in 1990. The tasks are as follows:

* Task 1: open the file ERA5_2mTemp_19900101-19900531_00h.nc in the shared data/Temperature/ERA5 folder and plot the temperature on January 1, 1990 on a map
* Task 2: calculate daily mean global temperature and plot the time series
* Task 3: calculate the mean temperature for each month (January-May) and plot the data on (five) global maps.
